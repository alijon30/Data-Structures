<!-- Introduction -->
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p align="justify">
  Preparing for a software engineering interview can be a daunting task, especially if you are not familiar with the types of problems that are typically asked. <a href="https://leetcode.com/">Leetcode</a> is a popular platform that provides a large collection of interview questions from top tech companies.
</p>
<p align="justify">
  This repository contains my solutions to some of the Leetcode-style software engineering interview problems. Each solution includes a Python implementation and an explanation of the algorithm used to solve the problem.
</p>
<!-- Usage -->
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p align="justify">
  To use this repository, simply navigate to the problem you are interested in and open the Python file. Each file is named after the problem and includes a solution and an explanation of the algorithm used.
</p>
<p align="justify">
  The solutions are written in Python 3 and are tested using the <a href="https://pytest.org/">pytest</a> framework. To run the tests, you will need to have pytest installed. You can install pytest by running the following command:
</p>
sh
Copy code
pip install pytest
<p align="justify">
  Once pytest is installed, you can run the tests by navigating to the root of the repository and running the following command:
</p>
sh
Copy code
pytest
<p align="justify">
  This will run all the tests in the repository and output the results to the console.
