Leetcode-style Software Engineering Interview Problems in Python
This is a collection of solutions for Leetcode-style software engineering interview problems in Python. The problems cover various topics such as algorithms, data structures, dynamic programming, and more.

Introduction
Preparing for a software engineering interview can be a daunting task, especially if you are not familiar with the types of problems that are typically asked. Leetcode is a popular platform that provides a large collection of interview questions from top tech companies.

This repository contains my solutions to some of the Leetcode-style software engineering interview problems. Each solution includes a Python implementation and an explanation of the algorithm used to solve the problem.

Usage
To use this repository, simply navigate to the problem you are interested in and open the Python file. Each file is named after the problem and includes a solution and an explanation of the algorithm used.

The solutions are written in Python 3 and are tested using the pytest framework. To run the tests, you will need to have pytest installed. You can install pytest by running the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install pytest
Once pytest is installed, you can run the tests by navigating to the root of the repository and running the following command:
